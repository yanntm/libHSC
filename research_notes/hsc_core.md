# Hierarchical Shape Calculus

*Working draft 5. Standalone: every object is defined from nothing.*

---

## 0. The stance

The object of study is the **classification of structured words**. A word is
a tuple bracketed by a tree; a classification assigns to each word a class;
the default classification is acceptance. An object *is* the equivalence
structure its classification induces on words. A representation is a tower of
quotients of that structure, one quotient per cut of the tree. Operations are
morphisms between classification spaces. Canonicity is uniqueness of the
quotient relative to a stated classifier.

The ambition, stated once: **hierarchy over arbitrary sorts mixed freely,
with one mechanism general enough to mediate operations between the algebras
of the parts.**

Three layers, strictly ordered by citizenship. **Codes** are the citizens:
finite, canonical, hashable; every object a computation touches is a code.
**Classes** are what codes mean relative to a classified object and a cut.
**Elements** of the underlying carriers are the extensional shadow — they fix
what equality of behaviour means, and are never consulted to compute
anything.

Two constants are never citizens. `0` is *adjoined*: carriers are extended by
a free point, so `0` is a legal answer and never a legal letter. `id` is
*free*: the empty composition, never represented. Extending pointed
definitions by adjoined elements, instead of admitting those elements into
the definitions, is the single move that eliminates the traditional
degenerate cases — and, as §4 shows, it is also what makes skipping cost
nothing.

The claimed contribution is one structural identification, from which the
rest follows:

> **Operations are shape-indexed in the same way data is.** The term algebra
> at a composite sort contains the product of the term algebras at its parts.
> Skipping, position-independent naming, and the saturation partition are not
> three mechanisms; they are three readings of that one sentence.

Deliberately out of scope: weighted and multi-terminal readings; inverse
images, absolute or relative; and the choice of shape, which §8 argues is not
a question this calculus should be asked.

## 1. Shapes and words

**Definition 1.1.** Fix a family of imported theories. **Shapes** are

```
V ::= 1 | ⟨A⟩ | (V_h , V_t)
```

with `⟦1⟧ = {•}`, `⟦⟨A⟩⟧ = U_A`, `⟦(V_h,V_t)⟧ = ⟦V_h⟧ × ⟦V_t⟧`. A **word**
of sort `V` is an element of `⟦V⟧`. The **frontier** of `V` is its sequence
of leaves, left to right; it exhibits words as tuples, bracketed statically
by the tree. A **position** is a path from the root.

Three commitments, each load-bearing later:

- **No names.** Positions are paths; ordered trees are rigid; two equal
  subterms are one object. Naming is surface decoration, erased at
  declaration.
- **No associativity.** `(V₁,(V₂,V₃))` and `((V₁,V₂),V₃)` are distinct sorts
  with a computed isomorphism between them. Refusing that quotient is what
  *hierarchical* means here.
- **The unit sort is mono-sorted.** `1` has no frontier; no position
  addresses it.

**Definition 1.2.** At `1` sit, as one object: the terminal value, the
default classification, and the base case of the default classifier.

## 2. Theories: a six-map interface

A leaf imports an external domain through a finite window. The window, not
the domain, is what the calculus sees. The window is smaller than one might
expect, and pinning down exactly how small is the first result.

**Definition 2.1 (support algebra).** A family `ℛ ⊆ 2^U` containing `∅`, with
canonical finite codes for its elements, closed under finite union, finite
meet, and **relative** difference `A ∖ B`. This is a generalised Boolean
algebra: relatively complemented, distributive, least element, **no top
required**.

**Definition 2.2 (local terms).** A theory exports a term algebra `𝒯` with a
distinguished `id`, an action `· : 𝒯 × ℛ → ℛ`, a sum `+ : 𝒯² → 𝒯`, and a
reflexive closure `(−)^* : 𝒯 → 𝒯` satisfying

```
id · A = A            (t + u) · A = t·A ∪ u·A            t^* · A = ⋃_{n≥0} tⁿ·A
```

The theory is handed a *maximal* term — the whole thing, guards, updates,
composition, sum, closure — and interprets it however it likes. Splitting a
code, acting per piece, and re-joining is what the calculus must never do to
a theory that has a native operation.

**Definition 2.3 (exported maps).** A theory may export maps `f : U → U'` by
exporting the pushforward `f_* : ℛ → ℛ'`. **No preimage is exported,
absolute or relative, and none is ever requested.**

**Proposition 2.4 (minimality of the interface).** A sort's entire
obligation to the calculus is six maps: `∪`, `∩`, `∖` on codes, and `·`, `+`,
`(−)^*` on terms.

*Why the usual suspects are absent.* **Equality** and **emptiness** appear in
every axiomatisation of such an interface and are not in this list. They are
discharged by canonicity rather than implemented: two codes denote the same
class iff they are the same code, and the empty class is the adjoined `0`,
which is an absence rather than a value. A theory is never asked either
question. **Complement** is absent because no construction below forms one;
relative difference is the only negation the calculus can express, and §4.7
shows it is enough. **Preimage** is absent by Definition 2.3.

**Definition 2.5 (currification).** A theory's codes are relative to a
position, not absolute: one indexing is ever instantiated, and every position
using that theory uses the same one. A leaf of width `k` uses the first `k`
names. Consequently *a code built for one position is the code for every
other position with the same local structure*.

The price is precise and is the origin of §7: a criterion relating
coordinates in two different positions cannot be a single object of the
theory, because both would use the same names.

**Definition 2.6 (interchange theory).** A criterion whose subterms are
evaluated in different theories needs a sort in which those theories agree;
that sort is declared, and the theory over it is the interchange theory.
Equality is always available; linear integer arithmetic is the working one.
Types are declared; alphabets are discovered.

**Obligation 2.7 (finite orbits).** For `t^*` to denote, the orbit
`{tⁿ·A}_{n≥0}` must be finite for every code `A`. This is not implied by
finiteness of `ℛ`'s codes: a shift on an unbounded integer domain has finite
codes and infinite orbits. A theory owes either a declaration that its terms
have finite orbits, or a bound. Stating this is not pedantry — it is the one
obligation whose omission turns a closure into a non-terminating computation
rather than a wrong answer.

## 3. Diagrams

**Theorem 3.1 (canonical decomposition).** Let `X` be a nonzero
classification at sort `(V_h,V_t)`. There is exactly one expression

```
X = Σ_{i=1..n} P_i ⊗ S_i
```

with the `P_i ∈ ℛ(V_h)` nonempty and pairwise **disjoint** (D), and the `S_i`
nonzero and pairwise **distinct** (F): the `S_i` are the distinct nonzero
sections `X(x,–)`, and the `P_i` are their fibres.

**Reading 3.2.** Define `x ~ x'` iff `X(x,–) = X(x',–)`. Theorem 3.1 says the
primes are the classes of this continuation congruence, constructed through
meets and differences; the subs are the class *names*, compared by code
equality. Dually `X` induces a congruence on the tail coordinate, which this
node does not materialise — the subs' own decompositions do, one cut at a
time. **A representation is the classification's congruence tower,
materialised one cut per node and deferred elsewhere.**

**Definition 3.3 (diagrams).** `Diag(1) = {0, 1}`; `Diag(⟨A⟩) = ℛ(A)` with
`0 = ∅`; `Diag((V_h,V_t))` is the adjoined `0` or a finite nonempty set of
pairs `{(P_i,S_i)}` satisfying (D) and (F). Arcs draw from the unpointed
carrier; `0` enters only as an answer.

**Construction 3.4 (the canonicalizer).** Write `Bag(V)` for finite multisets
of *rectangles* `(P,S) ∈ ℛ(V_h) × Diag(V_t)`. Define

```
canon : Bag(V) → Diag(V)
```

by incremental insertion into a maintained partition: for each rectangle,
meet it against the cells present, carve overlaps out by relative difference,
add sections where heads overlap, and group by sub. The cell whose expression
would require a top — the all-negative pattern — has section `0` and is
deleted by the pointed discipline before it is written. Every prime ever
written is a nonempty meet or a nonempty relative difference of primes
already present, which is exactly the invariant that maintains (D).

**Proposition 3.5 (universality).** Every operation whose codomain is
`Diag(V)` factors through `canon`. Union, meet, relative difference, and the
action of every operation term of §4 all present their result as a bag and
canonicalise it.

This is worth stating because it is what makes the calculus small: there is
one place where a diagram is made, one place where (D) and (F) are
established, and one place to look when either fails.

**Definition 3.6 (disjoint bags).** A bag is *pre-disjoint* if its heads are
already pairwise disjoint.

**Proposition 3.7.** On a pre-disjoint bag, `canon` reduces to grouping by
sub: no carving occurs. Meet, relative difference, and the action of a term
whose head component is a **selector** (§4.7) all produce pre-disjoint bags.
Union does not.

*Proof sketch.* For meet, the heads are `P_i ∩ Q_j` for two partitions, and
distinct `(i,j)` give disjoint results. For difference, each `P_i` is
partitioned among the `Q_j` plus a remainder. For a selector `s`, the heads
are `s·P_i ⊆ P_i`, and subsets of disjoint sets are disjoint. ∎

This is a statement about **cost, not meaning** — both paths compute the same
normal form. It belongs in the calculus anyway, because it identifies which
operations can be given a cheaper universal property, and because the
criterion turns out to be exactly *selector-hood*, which §4.7 defines for
independent reasons.

**Theorem 3.8 (internalisation).** For any shape whose head-position subtrees
are hereditarily tier G, `Diag(V)` equipped with `∪, ∩, ∖` and with the term
algebra of §4 satisfies Definition 2.1 and Definition 2.2. Hence `⟨Diag(V)⟩`
is a legal import: **the calculus eats its own output, and *hierarchical* is
this closure property.**

There is one diagram type, not two. A prime over a composite head *is* a
diagram over that head. The induced typing law: head subtrees uniformly tier
G, tail spines pay as they go — *classes need differences; names need
equality.*

---

## 4. Operations are shape-indexed

This is the section the rest of the paper turns on.

**Definition 4.1 (the term algebra).** For each sort `V` define `𝒯(V)` by
structural recursion:

```
𝒯(1)          = {id}
𝒯(⟨A⟩)        = the theory's own term algebra (Definition 2.2)
𝒯((V_h,V_t))  ⊇ 𝒯(V_h) ⊗ 𝒯(V_t)
```

closed in every case under `+`, `∘`, and `(−)^*`, and — at composite sorts
only — under the query/case bracket of §7. The **product term** `h ⊗ t` acts
by

```
(h ⊗ t) · ( Σ_i P_i ⊗ S_i )  =  canon { ( h·P_i , t·S_i ) }_i
```

and `id_{(V_h,V_t)} = id ⊗ id`.

Two things to notice, and they are the same thing seen twice. First, `𝒯` is
defined by recursion on the shape, in exact parallel with `Diag`. Second, the
recursion at a composite sort is *not* over positions of the frontier but
over the two subtrees; a term never names a leaf.

**Proposition 4.2 (the parallel).** `Diag((V_h,V_t))` is built from
`ℛ(V_h) × Diag(V_t)`; `𝒯((V_h,V_t))` is built from `𝒯(V_h) × 𝒯(V_t)`.
Operations have the shape of the data they act on.

**Theorem 4.3 (skipping is free).** `(id ⊗ t) · X` does not inspect the heads
of `X`, and its result has the same heads.

*Proof.* By Definition 4.1 the bag is `{(P_i, t·S_i)}`. The heads are
unchanged, hence still pairwise disjoint, hence by Proposition 3.7 no carving
occurs and no operation of `ℛ(V_h)` is invoked. ∎

The classical treatment introduces a *skip predicate* — an oracle answering
"does this operation touch this level?" — computed from a support set,
memoised per level, and consulted at every node. Theorem 4.3 removes the
question rather than answering it faster: `id` is free, free things are not
represented, and a term that transmits `id` to a subtree transmits nothing.
There is no predicate to compute and nothing to memoise. In particular
`id ⊗ id` collapses to `id`, so a term that touches one leaf of a large shape
is a path of that shape's depth and nothing else.

**Theorem 4.4 (currification of operations).** `𝒯(V)` depends on `V` alone.
Hence if two positions of a shape carry isomorphic subtrees, their term
algebras are equal — not isomorphic, equal — and a term written for one *is*
the term for the other.

*Proof.* Immediate from Definition 4.1: the recursion mentions no position. ∎

This is the operation-side counterpart of Definition 2.5, and it is the
reason the calculus can be currified at all. A presentation in which an
operation names an absolute coordinate cannot have Theorem 4.4: two
structurally identical events at different positions are then different
objects, share no codes, and share no computation. The obligation this places
on any presentation of the calculus: **no term may name a position.**

**Proposition 4.5 (the injections are additive).** The embeddings
`h ↦ h ⊗ id` and `t ↦ id ⊗ t` of `𝒯(V_h)` and `𝒯(V_t)` into
`𝒯((V_h,V_t))` preserve sums:

```
(h ⊗ id) + (h' ⊗ id)  =  (h + h') ⊗ id
(id ⊗ t) + (id ⊗ t')  =  id ⊗ (t + t')
```

*Proof.* Apply both sides of the first to `X = Σ_i P_i ⊗ S_i`. The left is
`canon{(h·P_i, S_i)}_i ∪ canon{(h'·P_i, S_i)}_i`; arcs with equal sections
merge by joining their heads, and the head algebra's sum is pointwise join,
so the union is `canon{((h+h')·P_i, S_i)}_i` — the right side. Dually for
sections, where arcs with equal heads merge. ∎

The mixed pair does **not** fold: `(h ⊗ id) + (id ⊗ t)` moves one side *or*
the other where `h ⊗ t` moves both, and they differ on any word both sides
can move. Grouping the one-sided summands per side and folding, recursively,
is therefore a **head-folded normal form** for sums: a sum of one-sided
terms collapses into a chain that mirrors the shape, O(depth) summands at
every level. Its point is Theorem 4.4's other half. Currification makes the
n conjugate instances of one event template *share their term*; what a flat
enumeration still holds apart is n wrapper chains saying *where*, and
Proposition 4.5 folds the chains into the shape. The enumerated family and
the folded chain become one code — the regularity of a symmetric system made
visible to hashing, not only to the eye. §8 measures both halves.

**4.6 Filters and updates are not generators.** They are primitive *inside* a
leaf term, and derived across a cut: §6 shows how far products and sums get,
and §7 takes over exactly where they stop.

**Definition 4.7 (the two faces, and selectors).** A support element `e`
types two ways: as a *point* ("these words") and as a *sub-identity* ("keep
these words"). One code, two typings; the second carries `∩` to `∘` and `∪`
to `+`. A term is a **selector** if `t·A ⊆ A` for all `A`.

**Theorem 4.8 (the guard algebra).** The sub-identity interval `[0, id_V]` is
a unital Boolean algebra even over non-unital supports: its top is `id`,
which is free, and complement is computed on data as a relative difference,
`(¬h)(w) = {w}` iff `h(w) = 0`. No top is needed anywhere.

The morphism algebra therefore strictly outruns the data algebra: a derived
predicate such as *deadlocked* — the complement of the union of all enabling
guards — is computable against the data present, with no `⊤` in sight.

**Proposition 4.9.** The operator semiring is zerosumfree
(`h + h' = 0 ⟹ h = h' = 0`, hence monotone fixpoints) but not
zero-divisor-free (disjoint guards compose to `0` with both nonzero).
Negation, banished from the semiring, survives exactly on the idempotent
interval, where the free unit gives it something to be relative to.

**4.10 Deadlock is exact.** A class pair contributing nothing contributes the
empty sum, a value of the same construction that produces every other. No run
is ever an under-approximation on account of a junked class.

---

## 5. Closure, and saturation as an identity

**Definition 5.1.** `H^*` is the least fixed point of `X ↦ X ∪ H·X`;
equivalently `Σ_{n≥0} Hⁿ`. It is reflexive by construction.

Consider a closure at a composite sort whose operand is a sum of events. By
Definition 4.1 each product-shaped event is `h ⊗ t`, and reading the pair
partitions the sum with no analysis whatever:

```
F = Σ_j (id ⊗ f_j)     reaches the tail only
L = Σ_k (l_k ⊗ id)     reaches the head only
G = the remainder      reaches both
```

Write `𝐅 = id ⊗ (Σ_j f_j)^*` and `𝐋 = (Σ_k l_k)^* ⊗ id`. Both are terms at
this sort whose components are *closures one level down*.

**Theorem 5.2 (saturation).** With `H = id + F + L + G`,

```
H^*  =  ( 𝐅 ∘ 𝐋 ∘ (id + g_1) ∘ ⋯ ∘ (id + g_m) )^*
```

for any enumeration `g_1,…,g_m` of `G`.

*Proof.* Write `K` for the operand on the right. Every factor of `K` is `≥
id` and `≤ H^*`; since `H^*` is reflexive and transitively closed it is
closed under composition, so `K ≤ H^*` and hence `K^* ≤ H^*`. Conversely,
because each factor is `≥ id`, each factor is `≤ K`; in particular `F ≤ 𝐅 ≤
K`, `L ≤ 𝐋 ≤ K`, and each `g_i ≤ K`, so `H ≤ K` and `H^* ≤ K^*`. ∎

Three readings, and the third is the point.

**The identity is unique; the schedule is not.** The proof used nothing about
the order of the factors. Every ordering — and every interleaving that keeps
each factor `≥ id` — yields the same closure. Ordering is therefore a purely
extensional degree of freedom: it moves the bill and cannot move the meaning.
Where implementations of this schedule differ from one another — re-applying
the local closure after each crossing event, or closing each `g_i`
individually before moving on — they are choosing among instances of Theorem
5.2, and no such choice needs a soundness argument. That is a much better
account than treating one arrangement as canonical.

**Hierarchy is automatic.** `(Σ_j f_j)^*` is a closure at `V_t` and
`(Σ_k l_k)^*` a closure at `V_h`, so Theorem 5.2 applies again, one level in.
The recursion bottoms out where a theory closes its own local term
(Definition 2.2). No annotation, no user-supplied locality, no declared
decomposition — the split is *read off* the product structure of the terms.
The split is also exactly the grouping Proposition 4.5 folds: `F`'s operand
`Σ_j f_j` is the folded tail-sum, `L`'s the folded head-sum. A sum kept in
head-folded normal form arrives at Theorem 5.2 already partitioned, at every
level at once.

**Why the saturated form is cheaper.** Both sides of Theorem 5.2 denote the
same operator, so the difference is entirely in evaluation. Under
memoisation keyed by `(term, argument)`, the right-hand side keys on
*subterms applied to nodes*: `𝐅` meets the same sub-diagram repeatedly across
the computation and answers immediately after the first time. Round-based
iteration of the left-hand side applies `H` to a *fresh* argument each round,
so the key differs each round and the memo never fires. The customary
slogan — a node is saturated once — is precisely the statement that the
closures sit inside the term rather than outside it.

**Proposition 5.3 (soundness has a cheap witness).** Theorem 5.2 is an
identity between operators on canonical objects. Since diagrams are
canonical, agreement of the two sides on an argument is decidable by code
equality. A saturating implementation therefore admits an exact differential
oracle against naive iteration, at any sort, on any model.

---

## 6. What products and sums already reach

Definition 4.1 gives product terms and sums. It is worth knowing precisely
how much of ordinary modelling that is, because the answer is: most of it,
and the boundary is not where one expects.

**Definition 6.1.** A criterion `φ ⊆ ⟦V⟧` is **separable** if it lies in the
distributive lattice generated by criteria each of which constrains a single
position of the frontier. An update `u : ⟦V⟧ → ⟦V⟧` is separable if it is a
product of per-position maps.

**Theorem 6.2 (the query-free fragment).** Separable criteria and separable
updates are exactly those expressible by product terms and sums.

*Proof sketch.* A single-position criterion `φ_ℓ` is the product term with
`φ_ℓ` at `ℓ` and `id` elsewhere. Conjunction is the product term carrying all
the components at once — one traversal, not a composition. Disjunction is the
sum of the corresponding product terms: `(φ_1 ⊗ id) + (id ⊗ φ_2)` selects
exactly the words satisfying either. Products and sums generate the
distributive lattice, and conversely a product term constrains each position
independently by construction. ∎

**Corollary 6.3.** A criterion whose *support spans a cut* need not be
crossing in any expensive sense. The condition "no smaller ring sits on
either of these two poles", though it mentions every position below a cut, is
a conjunction of per-position conditions and is a single product term. So is
a Petri transition, whose guard and update are per-place. So is mutual
exclusion, once the shared resource is given its own position rather than
being encoded implicitly into its neighbours' states.

This corrects a natural but wrong reading of Definition 2.5. The obstruction
there is *not* that a criterion mentions several positions; it is that a
criterion may **fail to factor** into per-position parts. Support crossing a
cut is cheap. Non-separability is what costs, and §7 is about that and only
that.

**Proposition 6.4.** The separable fragment is closed under the saturation of
Theorem 5.2: if every event is a product term, then `F`, `L` and `G` are, and
so are `𝐅` and `𝐋`.

---

## 7. Queries and cases: the inseparable fragment

What remains is exactly the criteria and updates outside Definition 6.1:
`a < b + c` relating positions across a cut, `x ≔ y + z`, `tab[i] ≔ e`. These
cannot be product terms, because by Definition 2.5 both ends would name the
same coordinates.

The construct is a **query/case bracket**: at a cut, a query partitions the
head by the *residual* of a criterion — what remains to be decided once the
head's contribution is known — and the case dispatches on the residual,
sending each class a continuation into the tail. The residual is a code of
the interchange theory (Definition 2.6); the calculus never interprets it,
but the theories at the two ends must interpret it identically, and that
agreement is what declaring the interchange theory buys.

**The partition primitive.** A theory must export `split_equiv`: partition a
code by the residual of a criterion, returning the realised classes indexed
by residual. Enumerating the carrier is a legal implementation and the honest
one for a small finite carrier; a theory earns its keep by returning few
structured codes where enumeration would return many singletons.

**Proposition 7.1.** By Theorem 3.8 diagrams are a theory; therefore diagrams
must export `split_equiv`. There is no leaf case and node case — one
construct, whose leaf instance is delegated and whose node instance is the
bracket itself, one level in.

**The crossing event under saturation.** An event in `G` — one that reaches
both sides of a cut — is a case, and re-saturation is fused into its reply,
because the reply is a morphism and morphisms compose. Whether the event
factors as `l ∘ f` survives only as a **cost regime**, never as a case
distinction in the semantics.

This section is built: the bracket compiles crossing guards and updates,
`split_equiv` is exported by the working leaf theory and by diagrams, and
every criterion outside Definition 6.1 — two-position comparisons,
arithmetic across a cut, array access under an unresolved index, quantified
disjunctions spanning many positions — takes this path, in events and in
queries alike. What §6 bought remains true in the built system: the
separable fragment never enters the bracket, and the two regimes meet only
as a cost boundary. Open 1 retains the parts still unsettled — residual
normalisation, and the schedule interaction when the reply does not factor.

---

## 8. The object is shape-free; the representation is not

`⟦V⟧` depends on the frontier of `V`, not on its bracketing. Two shapes with
the same frontier denote the same words and admit a computed isomorphism.
`Diag(V)` does *not* depend only on the frontier.

**Proposition 8.1.** There are families of classifications and pairs of
shapes `V, V'` over the same frontier for which `|Diag(V)|` is `O(log n)` and
`|Diag(V')|` is `Θ(n)` — and other families for which the same two shapes
exchange roles.

For a ring of `n` identical components whose interaction is nearest-neighbour
and whose cuts are each crossed by a bounded number of constraints, a
balanced shape shares every segment of equal length and the representation
does not grow with `n`; a spine pays one level per component. For a system
whose events reach a *suffix* of the frontier, the spine makes exactly those
events skippable in the sense of Theorem 4.3 while a balanced shape cuts
across every one of them, sending each into `G` at every level.

Both regimes are measured, not conjectured. An `n`-philosopher ring at a
balanced shape adds four nodes to the reachable set's representation per
doubling of `n` (32 nodes at `n = 256`, 56 at `n = 16384`); the spine's
representation is two orders larger already at `n = 256`. The same
experiment measures the operation side and confirms both halves of
Proposition 4.5's reading: the shared residuals of the `n` conjugate events
are a constant number of codes independent of `n` (Theorem 4.4 at work),
while the flat enumeration's wrapper chains contribute exactly `2n − 1`
codes per event template — sites, not operations.

The road from `Θ(n)` construction to `O(log n)` is *declaration*, and it is
built. A family whose declaration passes a checkable uniformity
certificate — one index over its full range, used only to address
components at bounded constant offsets modulo `n`; scalar and circular
sets are the recognized instances — never has its sites enumerated. The
folded chain is built by recursion over the interned shape, memoized per
(subtree sort, component alignment): the level recurrence
`R_d = (R_{d−1} ⊗ id) + (id ⊗ R_{d−1})`, where an instance straddling a
cut is compiled once, flat, at the block containing both of its ends — the
seam terms, and the ring closing at the root, are exactly the straddlers,
not separate machinery. Canonicity makes the construction verified rather
than trusted, by the same cheap witness as Proposition 5.3: the declared
term and the enumerated-then-folded term must be the *same code*, and are,
at every size checked. Measured on the ring at the balanced shape, the
operation side falls from `~6n` codes enumerated (98 335 at `n = 16384`)
to `21 log₂ n − 8` declared (286); at `n = 2^20` the reachable set is 80
nodes — `4 log₂ n` on the nose — and the closure contributes no
measurable time, because a sum kept in head-folded normal form arrives at
Theorem 5.2 already partitioned and the fixpoint memo, keyed on (term,
argument), coincides across the blocks of a level. The residual `Θ(n)` is
the declaration text of the `n` components themselves — surface, not
calculus.

Neither is a defect. Both are the same object under different presentations,
and the presentations differ in cost by margins that grow with `n` in both
directions. It follows that **the shape is a parameter of the representation,
supplied from outside**, and choosing it well is a question about a model's
dependency structure — a community-detection problem over a graph in which
control dependencies and data dependencies are distinguished — rather than a
question about this calculus. The scalar-set lineage's grouping dial is
accordingly surface syntax for declared shapes here, not a mechanism of the
calculus: one level of blocks of `G` components, or `G`-ary branching per
level recursively, whose branching-2 point is exactly the balanced tree.
Measured on the ring at `n = 256`, widening the branching factor shortens
the operation side (1615 term codes at branching 2 down to 1217 at 16) and
pays in node sharing (32 reachable-set nodes up to 120) — a tradeoff that
belongs to the model, chosen from outside like the shape it decorates. The
calculus consumes a shape and refuses to guess one; the honest statement of
its scope includes saying so.

---

## 9. Degenerations

The calculus specialises rather than competing with its special cases. Each
boundary below is recognisable from the syntax alone, and specialising across
it must cost nothing.

**Flat.** Take `V` a right spine of leaves, each `⟨A⟩` with `A` a finite
enumerated domain, and every term separable (Theorem 6.2). Then primes are
sets of values, `canon` is the classical union of decision-diagram nodes, the
partition of §5 is the classical per-level split, and Theorem 5.2 is the
classical saturation schedule. The classical flat calculus is *the value of
this calculus at the spine*, not a competitor to it.

**Single leaf.** Take `V = ⟨A⟩`. Diagrams are theory codes, terms are theory
terms, and the calculus disappears into the theory — as it should.

**Query-free.** Take every term separable. §7 never fires; the operation
basis is `id`, products, sums, composition, closure. Saturation is unaffected
(Proposition 6.4). This is the fragment in which the entire structure of §§3–6
is already exercised, which is why it is a sensible place to stop and check.

**No hierarchy in the heads.** Take every head position to be a leaf. Then
Theorem 3.8 is never used and the tower is one level deep in the sense that
matters, though the spine may be long.

## 10. Open

1. **The inseparable fragment (§7).** The bracket, its contract, its
   residual normalisation, and its interaction with Theorem 5.2 when the
   reply does not factor.
2. **A syntactic criterion for pre-disjointness beyond selectors.**
   Proposition 3.7 gives selectors; the general condition is that the head
   component maps disjoint codes to disjoint codes, which is a property of a
   theory's terms that a theory could declare.
3. **Finite orbits (Obligation 2.7).** What a theory should be required to
   declare, and whether the calculus can discharge it structurally for the
   fragment of §6.
4. **Cost regimes.** Theorem 5.2 leaves the schedule free. Which instance to
   choose is an extensional-free parameter, and the calculus should be able
   to *say* what distinguishes them without pretending one is canonical.
5. **Isomorphism between shapes.** §8 asserts a computed isomorphism between
   shapes over a common frontier. Its cost, and whether re-shaping a
   representation in place is ever cheaper than rebuilding it, is open.
6. **Regular families beyond one translation index.** The single-index
   certificate — full range, bounded constant offsets modulo `n` — is
   built and verified by code identity (§8); scalar and circular sets are
   its instances. Open is everything richer: several indices (a family
   over ordered pairs has orbit structure that translation does not see),
   dependent ranges ("all j except i"), the general form of seams for
   interactions wider than a bounded offset — and the quotient itself:
   the fold shrinks the representation of a symmetric system, an orbit
   reduction would shrink the system, and the certificate that licenses
   the one ought to license the other.
